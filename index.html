          <h2>RallyPoint</h2>
          <p>Once users login, they can add a new match, join an open match, view the scoreboard, and discuss in the forum. When adding a new match, the creator sets the time and location of the game. The creator can choose another registered user as an opponent, or select -Open- if the creator would like to leave the match open for other users to join.  Users can then view match details such as the location on a map generated by Google Maps API. Once the match has been played, the players enter the scores for the games. The playersâ€™ stats are updated on the global scoreboard.</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I am Wesley Cowan and I am a full-stack web developer with a background in nuclear engineering and education. I have always been drawn to the overlap of math, music, and programming. My dream is to either work in the field of computational fluid dynamics or develop virtual studio technolgy. I recently graduated from Coding Dojo where I developed a broad range of skills ranging from UX and design to back end development. I am excited to take on new challenges and to enrich my passion for coding.</p>
